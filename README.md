# Cat Slot Machine – My First Web Dev Project

Welcome to **Cat Slot Machine**, a super-simple, fun little project I built while starting my journey into web development!
It’s made using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and is all about rolling for cute cats and earning coins based on their rarity.

## 🎮 Features

* 🎰 **Single Roll Button** – Just click the button to roll a random cat.
* 🐾 **Random Cat Generator** – Each cat has a different rarity.
* 💰 **Earnings Based on Rarity** – Rare cats reward you with more coins.
* 🌱 **Beginner-Friendly Code** – This is my first web development project, so everything is simple and easy to understand.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. You click the **Roll** button.
2. The slot machine picks a **random cat** from the list.
3. Each cat has a rarity value (e.g., Common, Rare, Legendary).
4. You earn money depending on the rarity of the cat you got.
5. Your total money updates on the screen.

## 🙌 About This Project

This was my **first ever project in web development**, created to understand the basics of DOM manipulation, styling, and simple JavaScript logic.
It helped me get comfortable with building small interactive apps.
